- 👋 Hi, I’m @rlope234
- 👀 I am currently learning Python and C++. I am wishing to learn Javascript, but I learned the basics of those two languages in high school. 
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in the University of the Rio Grande Valley.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who is happy to let me know of any tips or critics on my code to hopefully make it "better".
